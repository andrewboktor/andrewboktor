Revised recipe, written on 6th of september 2010

Dough:
1/2 kg of "de2i2 semid" or griess in german (weichweizen)
250 ml (1 cup) of sugar
250 ml of milk
around 50 gm of molten butter
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp active dry yeast

Syrup:
400 ml (1 2/3 cups) of sugar
400 ml of water
1/2 tsp lemon juice

Ustensils:
Mixing bowl
30 cm lightly greased pan for baking

Mix all dough dry ingredients, then add the butter then the milk while mixing till a loose paste forms. Let it sit for 10 minutes.
Put in a 190-200 degrees oven for around 40 minutes (until golden red/brown)

once you put the dough in the oven, add the water to the sugar to make the syrup, bring to a boil, after all sugar is dissolved add the lemon juice and set aside to cool.

once the dough is out of the oven, sprinkle the syrup on top lightly (no pouring) until all the syrup is on the dough (dough could take a little time till the syrup is absorbed)

let it cool to room temperature then cut and serve.

almonds or other nuts could be sprinkled on top of the dough before baking, press them lightly inside the dough after sprinkling.
about 1/2 cup of coconut could be added to the dough.
