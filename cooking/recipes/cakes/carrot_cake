ngredients:
Cake:
1 cup oil
2 cups all purpose flour
2 cups sugar
1 pack backing powder cocks
4 big eggs or 5 small ones
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 teaspoons grounded cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups carrots (mabsour)
 
Dressing:
1 cup of sugar (then ground it)
1 teaspoon of grounded cinnamon
 
put the oil and the eggs and mix them well then add the vanilla and mix, add the sugar and mix then add the flour and the baking powder slowly while mixing add the salt and the cinnamon while mixing very well. add then the carrot and mix really really well.
get a 26 cm baking pan, oil it, then put some flour in and shake it well so it sticks to the oil. pour ur mix and put in a preheated oven (dunno the exact temprature), leave it for around 45 mins b4 opening to check it (if u open b4 that it'll tebouz).
it should take around 1 hour to get cooked. to check if it's done, insert a thin knife into the middle of your cake 2 or 3 times, when u get the knife out, if u see ANY traces the cake left on it, then it still needs to stay more in the oven.
 
put the cinnamon on the grounded sugar, add one table spoon of water and stirr really really well keep doing so and add more water if needed but add it in really really small amounts and stirr well after adding water everytime keep doing it till you get a THICK paste, much thicker than honey, thicker that the cake paste after it was done. spead it on the top of your cake after it has cooled down to room temp. LEAVE the dressing in the air for a while to harden, otherwise it might melt when closed or when subject to some little heat.
 
Enjoy.
 
alternations, u might add more sugar, more cinammon or some nuts, peanuts are the best.
 
the one you ate today was with exactly no alternations from the recipe.
 
Bon Appetit.
