The abstract is a very important and obligatory part of the report
allowing the potential reader to judge, if he is the target of this
report.  The abstract should be written with broadly understandable
technical language and should be self-contained, i.e. should not
contain any references or citations. Also the usage of abbreviations
and acronyms should be avoided, since the same acronyms or
abbreviations can have different meanings on different research
fields.  The abstract should typically contain about 300 words and in
any cases not more than one page.  The definition of the research
field and the most important outcome of the presented research are the
obligatory components of the abstract.
