################################## TODO ########################################
Add the rest of the pseudo-codes
Add figures to latex
Future work: talk about adding drawings according to references, and allowing the scalin of some drawings.
Concepts: add the same

################################ MEETINGS ######################################

**Meeting 13th August 2008
BFORE:
	Ask about the SVG

AFTER:
	Take care about copying text
	Send the file with the concepts chapter
	take another look @ graphviz
	check what graphviz do
	differenciate between semantics
	other scripting like pstex
	check papers on the graphviz website
